    gpuzzletime has been renamed to ptimelog. Along with this update, ptimelog
    has already been installed. The previous executable is now a
    migration-script.

    You can safely uninstall gpuzzletime. If you miss the executable
    gpuzzletime afterwards, you can recreate the migration-script version by
    reinstalling ptimelog.

    Sorry for the inconvenience.
